This tutorial will walk you through the basics of setting it up and using the
InfluxDB Line Protocol (ILP) using TCP. For an added bonus, we'll see how to
migrate from using InfluxDB to using QuestDB with a single-line configuration
change.

<!--truncate -->

## Configuring TCP InfluxDB line protocol listener

Here's the best part, at least for a basic implementation that you don't need to
performance tune at all: It's already set up.

That's right, as soon as you start QuestDB, the TCP ILP listener starts
automatically on port `9009`.

There are many configuration options you can tune in your `conf/server.conf`
file if you're interested. I won't go through them here, but you can read all
about them in our [docs](/docs/reference/api/ilp/overview/). I hope they are
relatively self-explanatory.

## InfluxDB line protocol refresher

If you have used ILP before, this should all be review. If you're new to ILP,
this will tell you how you should write your data to QuestDB.

### Basic structure

```shell title="ILP syntax"
table_name,tagset valueset timestamp
```

Pretty basic. So let's dive into what each element actually is and how to
structure a line of ILP for writing.

The first element is the `table_name` portion, which tells the ILP writer which
database table to write values into.

Next comes the set of tags you want to use. These are standard `key=value`
pairs, and you can add as many of them as you want or need. Just separate them
with commas.

There should only ever be 2 spaces in your line protocol. No more. The first
space separates your `tags` from the `values` you want to associate with those
`tags`s. The second space separates the values from the timestamp for those tags
and values.

The values are also `key=value` pairs, and again you can send as many as you
want in a line.

Finally comes your `timestamp` value, typically in ÂµSeconds.

### Example ILP

Let's use an example of writing some environmental data to QuestDB. I have a
sensor that reads the temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, and altitude:

| Reading     | Value       |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Temperature | 23.180000   |
| Humidity    | 51.982422   |
| Pressure    | 1002.112061 |
| Altitude    | 93.146370   |

And I want to use the following `tag`s:

| Tag Name | Tag Value |
| -------- | --------- |
| dev_id   | THP002    |
| dev_loc  | Apex      |
| dev_name | BME280    |

And my `table_name` is `iot`

Now I have all the basic elements I need to construct my ILP, which will look
like this:

```shell
iot,dev_id=THP002,dev_loc=Apex,dev_name=BME280 temp_c=23.18,altitude=93.10,humidity=52.16,pressure=1002.12
```

And yes, I rounded those values. But you'll notice that I did not add a
`timestamp` value. In this case, it's because I am sending the values from a
small, embedded sensor device that really doesn't have a great sense of time. By
sending the ILP without a `timestamp` I'm telling the database itself to add one
for me, using the `timestamp`s arrival time.

## Database structure

One of the cool features of using the ILP reader (well, QuestDB in general,
really) is the ability to do 'Schema on Write'.

What that means is that if an ILP message arrives, QuestDB will automatically
create tables and columns to fit the incoming ILP. So if you need to add a `tag`
later, you can add it to the new device's tagset and start writing. The new tag
will get added to the schema.

If you leave a tag value off, and it exists in the database, it will fill a
`null` value.

When I start writing the above ILP to QuestDB, I'll get a table that looks like
this:

| dev_id | dev_name | temp_c | humidity | timestamp                   | dev_loc | altitude | pressure |
| ------ | -------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------- |
| THP002 | BME280   | 26.52  | 51.94    | 2020-07-21T14:54:59.156202Z | Apex    | 76.27    | 1004.12  |
| THP002 | BME280   | 26.54  | 51.85    | 2020-07-21T14:54:59.157358Z | Apex    | 75.97    | 1004.16  |
| THP002 | BME280   | 26.56  | 51.83    | 2020-07-21T14:54:59.157389Z | Apex    | 75.84    | 1004.17  |
| THP002 | BME280   | 26.58  | 51.79    | 2020-07-21T14:54:59.287416Z | Apex    | 75.93    | 1004.16  |

This is what that table looks like in the QuestDB Web Console:

## But how did you write that?

Oh, so how did I write that ILP to QuestDB? Well, QuestDB supports
[ILP client libraries](/docs/reference/clients/overview/) for some of the most
popular programming languages, so there are a few options. Here is an example
code using the official Python client library. It inserts the following row:

```shell
iot,dev_id=THP002,dev_loc=Apex,dev_name=BME280 temp_c=23.18,altitude=93.10,humidity=52.16,pressure=1002.12
```

```python title="Inserting a row into the table iot"

from questdb.ingress import Sender, IngressError, TimestampNanos
import sys


def example(host: str = 'localhost', port: int = 9009):
    try:
        with Sender(host, port) as sender:
            sender.row(
                'iot',
                symbols={
                    'dev_id': 'THP002',
                    'dev_loc': 'Apex'},
                columns={
                    'dev_name': 'BME280',
                    'temp_c': 23.18,
                    'altitude': 93.10,
                    'humidity': 52.16,
                    'pressure': 1002.12})
            sender.flush()

    except IngressError as e:
        sys.stderr.write(f'Got error: {e}\n')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    example()
```

This will connect the client to the QuestDB Server defined by `port` at `9009`.

`sender.flush()` flushes the internal buffer and we recommend flushing
periodically, for example every few seconds.

If, similar to this example, you're relying on QuestDB to add `timestamps`, then be
aware that QuestDB will give the entire batch sequential timestamps based on
when they are read/written to the database.

## Conclusions

InfluxDB Line Protocol (ILP) is a simple, well-known, and relatively compact
data format for sending Time Series data to a database. That's why we decided to
support it.

I'm now going to give you a simple configuration change to migrate from using
InfluxDB to using QuestDB. If you're using Telegraf as a data collector, we have
[documentation for integrating with QuestDB](/docs/third-party-tools/telegraf/)
for more details, but to summarize the migration, edit `telegraf.conf` (it may
be in different places, depending on your operating system) and change the line:

```shell
[[outputs.influxdb]]
  urls = ["http://127.0.0.1:8086"]
```

to be:

```shell
[[outputs.socket_writer]]
  address = "tcp://127.0.0.1:9009"
```

That's it. That's the migration. All data that was previously being written to
InfluxDB will now be written to QuestDB.
